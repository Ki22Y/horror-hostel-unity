I built a 3D first-person horror game using Unity, C#, and URP, fully optimized for Android.

⚙️ Features:

Ghost AI with NavMesh

Random key spawning

Flickering lights + URP post-processing

Game over system with mobile UI

This project taught me so much about game logic, AI, and building immersive gameplay loops.

📱 Built for Android | 🎮 Solo-developed from scratch
